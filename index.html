    <h1>Simple HTML Blog</h1>
    <h2>Friday 10 Sept 2021</h2>
    <p>Today I decided to start <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">#100DaysOfCode</a>. I will continue working through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> for the next 100 days according to the challenge rules.</p>
    <p>This is a simple HTML blog made as an exercise for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> is a fun and educational website that teaches web development, and they have just added new lessons to their Foundations module. I wholly recommend signing up if you want to learn web design, web development, Git, GitHub, and Linux.</p>
